The Number Guessing Game is a simple and fun interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected number chosen by the computer. The game provides real-time feedback to guide the player toward the correct number through hints based on how close their guess is to the target. The goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible, with the player receiving increasingly detailed hints about the proximity of their guesses.

Game Features and Flow:

Random Number Selection:

The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100 (or another range if customized). The playerâ€™s task is to guess this hidden number.

User Input:

The player inputs their guess as an integer (e.g., 50). The game responds with hints that help the player refine their next guess.

Hint System:

The game uses a dynamic hint system to give feedback on how close the player's guess is to the correct number.
The feedback includes:
1. "Too low" or "Too high" if the guess is far from the target.
2. "You're somewhat close" if the guess is within 5-10 units of the target.
3. "Almost there" if the guess is very close, within 2 units of the correct number.
4. "Getting warmer" indicates the guess is getting closer, even if it's not yet the correct number.
   
Attempts and Feedback:

The player has a limited number of attempts (e.g., 10), and they receive feedback after every guess. The game tracks how many attempts the player has made.
If the player guesses the correct number, the game congratulates them and displays the number of attempts taken and the time spent.

End of the Game:

The game ends when the player guesses the correct number or exhausts their allowed attempts.
If the player fails to guess the number within the given attempts, the game reveals the correct number.

Time Tracking:

The game tracks the time taken by the player to guess the correct number and displays it at the end, adding an element of urgency to the game.

Replay Option:

After the game ends, the player is given the option to play again, which restarts the game with a new random number.
